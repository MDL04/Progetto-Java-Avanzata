The forest was dark and mysterious. Tall trees grew everywhere in the forest. The trees blocked most of the sunlight. Small animals lived among the trees. Squirrels jumped from branch to branch. Birds sang beautiful songs in the trees. A small stream flowed through the forest. The stream made gentle sounds. Fish swam in the clear water of the stream. Hikers sometimes walked along the forest paths to enjoy nature.
