The old library stood quietly on the corner of Main Street. Books filled every shelf in the library. The books contained countless stories. People came to the library to read and study. Students studied for their exams. The librarian helped people find books. She knew where every book was located. The reading room had comfortable chairs. People sat in the chairs to read quietly. The library was a peaceful place for learning and thinking.
